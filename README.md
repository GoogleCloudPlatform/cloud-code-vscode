# Cloud Code for Visual Studio Code

Cloud Code for VS Code extends VS Code to bring all the power and convenience
of IDEs to developing cloud-native Kubernetes applications. With Googleâ€™s
command-line [container tools][1] like [`skaffold`][2] and [`kubectl`][3]
under the hood, Cloud Code gives you local, continuous feedback on your project
as you build it, extending this local edit-compile-debug loop to create
cloud-native Kubernetes environments, on your workstation or in the cloud.
Support for [deployment profiles][4] lets you define different environments,
like local development, shared development, test, or production, so you can
easily test and debug on your workstation or in the cloud.
